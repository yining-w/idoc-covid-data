## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
filtered <- confirmed %>%
  group_by(location) %>% 
  filter(location =="East Moline" |
           location == "Jacksonville" |
           location == "Menard" | 
           location == "Logan" |
           location == "Hill") %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=Day, y= incarcerated_recorvered, group=location), 
                     data = confirmed,
                     color = alpha("grey", 0.7)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=Day, y=incarcerated_recorvered, color=location), 
                     data = filtered)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
